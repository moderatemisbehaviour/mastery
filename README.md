# Mastery
*Master yourself*

# Overview
Mastery is an app that can help you to improve at anything whether it be learning a new language, losing weight, or just being a better listener 🙂👂

As humans we spend a lot of time thinking about our future ambitions, our past mistakes, and our present desires, so we are certainly not short of inspiration on how we might want to improve. To improve at something we must change our habits but when we try to do this we notice that its *really hard*! That's because changing our habits means changing *ourselves*. All improvement therefore begins with *self*-improvement.

True mastery is to master *yourself*.

# How to improve
Mastery uses three concepts to help you achieve self-improvement.
- ⚔️Disciplines
  - A discipline is an area you want to improve.
    - Spanish
    - Health
    - Listening
- 🎓Milestones
  - Milestones are important achievements on your path to mastering a certain discipline. They are tests that clearly demonstrate your progress. You should never run out of milestones on your path to mastery.
    - Count to 10 in Spanish.
    - Do 10 pushups without stopping.
    - Count how many alliterative words there are for each letter in Blackalicious' "Alphabet Aerobics".
- 💪Habits
  - Habits are small, easily achievable, daily tasks that hone the skills needed to achieve ever greater milestones. They are like 'reps' for a particular discipline.
    - Learn a new word and use it in a sentence.
    - Do a 20-minute Joe Wicks workout.
    - Ask a family member how their day went and listen to the entire answer.

# What to improve
You should also consider if the things you want to improve are actually the right things to improve!
Just because we spend a lot of time thinking about possible self-improvements doesn't mean they're the right ones.
The best people to tell us how we should improve are the people who are most dependent on us. Our family, friends, and colleagues.
